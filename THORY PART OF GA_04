Image-to-Image Translation Using pix2pix (Conditional GAN)
1. Introduction

Image-to-image translation is a computer vision task where an input image from one domain is transformed into a corresponding image in another domain while preserving structural information.

Examples:

Sketch → Photo

Black & white image → Color image

Satellite image → Map

Edge map → Real image

The pix2pix model, proposed by Isola et al. (2017), uses a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to learn this mapping using paired datasets.

2. What is a Conditional GAN (cGAN)?

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) consists of:

Generator (G) – generates fake images

Discriminator (D) – distinguishes real from fake images

A Conditional GAN extends GANs by conditioning both G and D on additional information, such as:

Class labels

Text

Input images

In pix2pix:

Condition = input image

Output = translated image

So the model learns:

𝐺
:
𝑋
→
𝑌
G:X→Y

Where:

X = input image (e.g., sketch)

Y = output image (e.g., photo)

3. pix2pix Architecture Overview

pix2pix consists of two main networks:

3.1 Generator – U-Net Architecture

The generator uses a U-Net architecture:

Encoder: downsamples image

Decoder: upsamples image

Skip connections: preserve spatial details

Why U-Net?

Maintains fine-grained details

Prevents information loss during downsampling

3.2 Discriminator – PatchGAN

The discriminator is a PatchGAN, which:

Classifies image patches (e.g., 70×70) as real or fake

Focuses on local texture realism

Improves sharpness

Instead of one output value, PatchGAN outputs a matrix of real/fake predictions.

4. Training Data Requirement

pix2pix requires paired images:

Input Image | Target Image
-------------------------
Sketch      | Photo
Edges       | Real image
Satellite   | Map


Both images must be:

Aligned

Same size

Same resolution

5. Loss Functions in pix2pix

pix2pix combines two loss functions:



6. pix2pix Training Process

Input image X is given to the generator

Generator produces fake image G(X)

Discriminator compares:

(X, Y) → real pair

(X, G(X)) → fake pair

Discriminator updates weights

Generator updates weights using GAN + L1 loss

Process repeats for multiple epochs
